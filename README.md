#### Build the image

You will need [Nix] installed with flakes support

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peprolinbot/tg-ha-door
cd tg-ha-door
nix build .#docker # This will build for the current architecture
docker load < ./result
docker images # You should see the loaded image
```

## üí™üèª Development

You will need [Nix] installed with flakes support, and the included `devShell` will take care of the rest

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peprolinbot/tg-ha-door
cd tg-ha-door
nix develop
go run . # For example
